# Networks
Repository for testing out networks on different datasets.

## Notebooks
Both notebooks are still under development. They lack proper data analysis and fine tuned models.
* Heart disease - model for classifying whether a patient has a heart disease.
* FIFA - regress the value of a player given a series of statistics.

## TODO
- [x] Implement core packages
- [x] Add python notebooks for the networks
- [ ] Incorperate Tensorboard
